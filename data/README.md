# dog_bred_classifier: Image Classifier for Dogs

This project is a part of my AWS AI/ML Scholarship at Udacity, where I'm studying for a nanodegree in Python AI programming. Using a supplied image classifier, I identify dog breeds, focusing on Python tools for evaluation, preprocessing, and classifier implementation. Breed identification, finding the best algorithm to classify images as "dogs" or "not dogs," and comparing accuracy to runtime are the goals.

### Programming Project

[Overview of the Python Project: Classifying Pet Photos](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND-revision/tree/master) to access the Intropy Project to Classify Pet Images. "Classifying Pet Images Project"  See which CNN architectural model recognizes dog breeds from pictures the best.

## Dependencies

The `requirements.txt` file located in each directory contains information on the minimal requirements required to run the notebooks in each directory.

### pip

You may use pip to install these dependencies by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
