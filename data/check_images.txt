Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:  Certainly, Dog_01.jpg was appropriately categorized as a "pug" by the three model designs.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg were accurately classified as "pugs" by VGG and ResNet (notice that in order to acquire the correct breed classifications, I actually modified the filenames to Pug_01.jpg and Pug.02.jpg). On the other hand, Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg were categorized as 'pug' and 'bull mastiff' by AlexNet.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: The item photo was accurately classified as a "coffee mug" by the three model architectures, which recognized it as a non-dog. On the other hand, AlexNet classed the cat image as a dog, 'leonberg,' whereas VGG and ResNet simply recognized it as a non-dog.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: 75% of the photos were properly identified by VGG and ResNet. Their respective classifications of the cat breed ('maine coon') as 'tabby' and 'tiger cat' were incorrect. However, the cat was recognized as such by both models, and it was not confused for a dog. ResNet was the model architecture that performed the best overall for this assignment due to its 00:00:03 runtime. In fact, VGG needed 00:00:06, or twice as long, to finish the assignment.
